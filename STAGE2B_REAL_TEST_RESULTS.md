## ⚠️ Note on Remaining Em Dashes

**1 em dash remains** (reduced from 4 → 3). This may be:
- Intentional (proper use of em dash in context)
- Acceptable (not flagged by Stage 2b's quality review)
- Edge case (may need further investigation)

**Recommendation:** Review the remaining em dash in context to determine if it's acceptable or needs further refinement.
