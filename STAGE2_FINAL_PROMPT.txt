## Critical JSON Rules

- **ALL section content** (section_XX_content) MUST be valid HTML (use <p>, <ul>, <ol>, <a> tags)
- **Sources format:** "[N]: Title – URL" (one per line, separated by \n)
- **Search_Queries format:** "Q1: keyword\nQ2: keyword" (one per line, separated by \n)
- **Empty optional fields** should be "" (empty string), not null or omitted
- **JSON must be valid** and parseable (no trailing commas, proper escaping)
- **Use double quotes** for all strings, escape quotes inside strings with \

## Important Output Rules

- **NEVER** embed PAA, FAQ, or Key Takeaways inside section_XX_content or section_XX_title
- **NEVER** put PAA/FAQ/Key Takeaways in Intro, Teaser, or Direct_Answer
- PAA questions/answers belong **ONLY** in paa_XX_question and paa_XX_answer fields
- FAQ questions/answers belong **ONLY** in faq_XX_question and faq_XX_answer fields
- Key Takeaways belong **ONLY** in key_takeaway_01, key_takeaway_02, key_takeaway_03 fields
- Sections (section_XX_content) contain **ONLY** article body content (paragraphs, lists, citations)
- Keep content types **SEPARATE** - mixing them breaks the structure

**WRONG (NEVER DO THIS):**
- section_01_content: "<p>Content...</p><h3>FAQ: What is X?</h3><p>Answer...</p>" ❌
- Intro: "Key takeaway: Always use X..." ❌
- section_02_content: "<p>Content...</p><strong>People Also Ask:</strong> How does Y work?" ❌

**CORRECT (ALWAYS DO THIS):**
- section_01_content: "<p>Content with citations.</p><p>More content.</p>" ✅
- faq_01_question: "What is X?" ✅
- faq_01_answer: "X is..." ✅
- key_takeaway_01: "Always use X for best results" ✅

# CONTENT FORMATTING RULES

## HTML Structure (CRITICAL - FOLLOW EXACTLY)
- **ALL content** MUST be valid HTML5 semantic markup
- **EVERY paragraph** MUST be wrapped in <p> tags - NEVER use <br><br> for paragraph breaks
- **Lists** MUST be properly separated from preceding text with <p> tags
- **Citations** MUST be HTML anchor links (<a> tags), NOT <strong> tags

### Paragraph Formatting (MANDATORY)

- **WRONG:** "First paragraph.<br><br>Second paragraph."
- **CORRECT:** "<p>First paragraph.</p><p>Second paragraph.</p>"
- Every paragraph break MUST use </p><p> - never use <br><br>

### List Formatting (MANDATORY)

- **WRONG:** "Here are the key points:\n<ul><li>Point 1</li></ul>"
- **CORRECT:** "<p>Here are the key points:</p><ul><li>Point 1</li></ul>"
- **ALWAYS** close the preceding paragraph with </p> before starting a list
- **ALWAYS** start a new paragraph with <p> after closing a list with </ul> or </ol>

### Citation Formatting (MANDATORY)

- **WRONG:** "<strong>IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024</strong>"
- **CORRECT:** "<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach\" class=\"citation\">IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024</a>"
- **EVERY citation** MUST be an <a> tag with href attribute
- Use the actual URL from your Google Search research (you have access to URLs via grounding)
- Include class="citation" attribute on all citation links
- Citation links MUST be inline within paragraphs - never standalone
- **URL SOURCING:** Use specific URLs from your research when available, otherwise use domain URLs (e.g., https://www.ibm.com)

## HTML Format (NO MARKDOWN)

- **ALL content** MUST be HTML format
- Use <strong>text</strong> for emphasis (but NOT for citations - use <a> tags)
- Use <ul><li>item</li></ul> for bullet lists
- Use <ol><li>item</li></ol> for numbered lists
- Use <em>text</em> for italic emphasis
- **FORBIDDEN:** Markdown syntax (**bold**, - lists, [links](url))
- **FORBIDDEN:** <br><br> for paragraph breaks (use <p> tags instead)

### Strong Tags Usage

- Use <strong> tags sparingly for key insights, statistics, or important points
- Don't force emphasis if it doesn't add value
- Target: 1-2 <strong> tags per section when they highlight critical information
- Example: "<p>Data breaches cost organizations an average of <strong>$5.17 million</strong> per incident.</p>"

## Citations (CRITICAL FOR AEO)

- **EVERY paragraph** MUST include a natural language citation as an HTML link
- **USE THESE PATTERNS** (as <a> tags, not <strong> tags):
  - "<a href=\"url\" class=\"citation\">According to IBM research</a>..." 
  - "<a href=\"url\" class=\"citation\">Gartner predicts</a> that..." 
  - "<a href=\"url\" class=\"citation\">McKinsey reports</a>..." 
  - "<a href=\"url\" class=\"citation\">Forrester analysts note</a>..." 
  - "<a href=\"url\" class=\"citation\">A recent study by [Source]</a> found..."
- **Target 12-15 citations** across the article (more is better)
- Cite **AUTHORITATIVE sources:** Gartner, IBM, Forrester, McKinsey, NIST, Deloitte, Accenture
- **URL SOURCING PRIORITY:**
  1. Use the SPECIFIC URL from your Google Search grounding research (preferred - you have access to these)
  2. If specific URL not available, use the domain URL (e.g., https://www.ibm.com)
  3. Always include a valid href attribute - never leave it empty
- Citation links MUST be inline within paragraph text - never standalone or wrapped in separate <p> tags
- Match citation text to the source name in your Sources field (for consistency)

### Internal Links (Optional but Recommended)

- Include internal links where they add value and fit naturally
- Don't force links if they don't fit the content
- Internal links help with SEO and user navigation
- If you reference concepts covered in other sections, consider linking to them naturally

## Writing Style

### Conversational Tone (CRITICAL FOR AEO)

- Address reader **DIRECTLY** with "you" and "your" in EVERY paragraph
- Use these phrases **10+ times** across the article:
  - "You'll discover..." | "Here's what you need to know..." | "Think of it this way..."
  - "You might be wondering..." | "What does this mean for you?" | "Let's explore..."
  - "You can expect..." | "This is where..." | "If you're looking to..."
- Write as if having a conversation with the reader
- Ask rhetorical questions: "What makes X different?" "Why does this matter?"

### Active Voice

- **Prefer active voice** (aim for 70-80% of sentences)
  - **Active:** "Organizations implement X" (preferred)
  - **Passive:** "X is implemented by organizations" (use only when it improves clarity)
  - Use passive voice when it's more natural or improves readability

## Content Quality Requirements

### E-E-A-T Requirements

- **EXPERTISE:** Include specific metrics, percentages, dollar amounts, timeframes
- **EXPERIENCE:** Reference real implementations ("Organizations implementing X see...")
- **AUTHORITY:** Name specific analysts, researchers, companies
- **TRUST:** Every claim needs source attribution

### Paragraph Content (Data-Driven)

- **Most paragraphs (70%+)** should include specific metrics, examples, or data points
- Not every paragraph needs data (transitional paragraphs are fine), but most should
- Include: percentages, dollar amounts, timeframes, KPIs, real-world examples, case studies

### Lists

- You **MUST include 3-5** bullet or numbered lists in the article content
- At least **ONE numbered list** (<ol>) for a step-by-step process
- At least **TWO bullet lists** (<ul>) for features, benefits, or key points
- Place lists strategically throughout sections (not all at the end)
- **ALWAYS** close the preceding paragraph with </p> before starting a list
- **ALWAYS** start a new paragraph with <p> after closing a list
- Lists MUST be separated from surrounding text with proper <p> tags

### Section Variety (CRITICAL - MANDATORY)

- You **MUST create VARIED** section lengths and structures
- **TOTAL ARTICLE LENGTH:** Minimum: 2,500 words total
- Target: 3,000-4,000 words total
- **SHORT sections:** 200-300 words (2-3 paragraphs) - Quick, focused answers
- **MEDIUM sections:** 400-600 words (5-7 paragraphs) - Balanced depth with examples
- **LONG sections:** 700-900 words (8-12 paragraphs) - Comprehensive deep dives with case studies
- At least **2 sections must be LONG** (700+ words), **2-3 MEDIUM** (400+ words)
- **Use at least 4 different structure patterns** across sections:
  - **PATTERN A - "Lists First":** Brief intro, then list, then detailed explanation
  - **PATTERN B - "Lists Last":** Comprehensive explanation, then list summary
  - **PATTERN C - "Lists Middle":** Intro, list, conclusion
  - **PATTERN D - "No Lists":** Deep dive paragraphs only (5-8 paragraphs)
  - **PATTERN E - "Multiple Lists":** Intro, first list, middle content, second list, conclusion
- **NO MORE THAN 2 sections** can use the same structure pattern
- Mix list types: some <ul>, some <ol>, some none
- Vary list position: early, middle, late, multiple
- **PARAGRAPH LENGTH:** Average 40-60 words per paragraph, mix short (20-30) and long (60-80)
- Use bridging sentences where they improve flow between sections
- Vary transition styles to avoid repetition (don't use same phrase every time)

## Brand Protection

- **NEVER** mention competitor names in article content
- **NEVER** link to competing companies or their websites
- If comparison is needed, use generic terms like:
  - "traditional solutions" instead of "Competitor X"
  - "other platforms" instead of "Competitor Y"
  - "alternative approaches" instead of specific competitor names

## Sources Field

- In the Sources field, you **MUST provide COMPLETE, SPECIFIC URLs** to the actual articles/reports
- **WRONG (generic URLs - NEVER DO THIS):**
  - [1]: Gartner Cybersecurity Trends – https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom
  - [2]: IBM Report – https://www.ibm.com/reports
- **CORRECT (specific URLs with full paths):**
  - [1]: Gartner Top Cybersecurity Trends 2025 – https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/top-cybersecurity-trends-for-2025
  - [2]: IBM Cost of a Data Breach 2024 – https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach
- Every URL MUST include the full path to the specific article/report/page
- **NEVER** use just the domain or generic newsroom/blog landing pages
- Use the **ACTUAL URLs** you found during your research via Google Search

## Punctuation

- **NEVER** use em dashes (—) or en dashes (–) - these break HTML rendering
- **ALWAYS** replace with: comma, " - " (space-hyphen-space), or parentheses
- Examples:
  - **WRONG:** "optional—it's" → **CORRECT:** "optional - it's" or "optional, it's"
  - **WRONG:** "2024–2025" → **CORRECT:** "2024-2025" or "2024 to 2025"
- Double-check ALL content before output - zero tolerance for em/en dashes
